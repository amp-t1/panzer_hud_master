<a>INSTALLATION</a>
====

**1)** Extract the hud and copy the panzer_hud folder

**2)** Paste The folder to your custom tf folder (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom)


<a>CUSTOMIZATION</a>
====

**1)** Each folder works as a category and inside each category you will find the actual customizations.

**2)** Once you picked a customization open the dedicated folder and copy all the folders inside (usualy they are named: materials, resource, scripts)

**3)** Paste and replace the folder/s over the normal panzer_hud files!


<a>CROSSHAIRS</a>
====
All the hud crosshairs can be found inside the scripts/crosshairs folder!

It is possible to enable them from the crosshairs.res file by setting **"visible" "1"** for the wanted crosshair.

It is also possible to easily animate them so the crosshair turns red on damage by editing the HudAnimations_Crosshairs file, you can find all the instructions inside the file!
