1) Extract the hud and copy the m0rehud folder

2) Paste The folder to your custom tf folder (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom)

NOTES:

I also suggest using "tf_hud_target_id_disable_floating_health" "1" since the floating version is not as consistan and can have problems.
